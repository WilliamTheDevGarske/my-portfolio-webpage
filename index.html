  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p class="dark-text">My interest in technology was sparked at a young age. When I was around 6 years old my mother got me a Nintendo 64, The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time, and a few other games. From then on, I was hooked. I was born and raised in Milwaukee, WI, and although I really miss my friends and family back home. I'm happy to be away from that frozen wasteland we call a state! After I turned 20 I actually ended up moving all the way to New Mexico to be with my girlfriend Alex. I then pulled her back to WI in hopes of finding a future, and although we couldnt find what we were looking for, it was another step in the right direction! Finally we decided to move to Texas and things were starting to look bleak, but then I realized that through it all videogames and other technology have always been around me and after that realization I figured, "Why not turn <b>that</b> into a career?". Luckily, I met a new friend here in Dallas who has been through the Thinkful program, and with her guidance I signed up! Now, this is where my journey truly begins. </p>
  <p class="dark-text">I have a passion for technology that I honestly cant really put into words. From game consoles, to cellphones, or even when I built my first PC. I have always thoroughly enjoyed learning how these things work. Now I've begun web development and although it has been challenging, its also extremely rewarding!</p>
  <p class="dark-text">I'm very excited to keep learning and growing! So, If you're a potential employer or even someone looking for a coding buddy to bounce your ideas with, please do not be afraid to contact me using the links below!</p>
